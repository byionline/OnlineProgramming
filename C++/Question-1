You are given three positive (i.e. strictly greater than zero) integers x, y and z.

Your task is to find positive integers a, b and c such that x=max(a,b), y=max(a,c) 
and z=max(b,c), or determine that it is impossible to find such a, b and c.

You have to answer t independent test cases. Print required a, b and c in any (arbitrary) order.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t
(1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers x, y, and z (1≤x,y,z≤109).



Solution:

Suppose X greater than equal to Y greater than equal Z.
If Y is not equal to Z then answer is No.
As Z is maximum of all the integers and appears in two pairs 
IF there exists an answer then it will be X, X, Z
